# TableManager
A javascript project to manage simple html tables

This javascript code and some accompanying files allow for the creation a simple html table that is related to an SQL table in a database.  The code will display the SQL table as an html table based on a JSON data file.  This data file is something that you create in some manner, but will need to follow the template that is provided.  In it you specifiy the database and the SQL table to display, classes to modify the display, information on the type of input, how the buttons are displayed, and other informat.  There is more information on the JSON structure in the TblMgrTemplateComment.json file.  Once the SQL table is displayed it can be modified by changing data in the columns, adding a new row at the bottom, and removing highlighted rows.  The table manager will also highlight selected rows as read and highlight rows yellow when the mouse pointer hovers over a row.  Three buttons are provided that will display at the end of the table.  The buttons are to add a row, delete a row, or save/close the table.
